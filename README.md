This report documents the forensic investigation of Mr. Williams, who was suspected of capturing and distributing proprietary images of ACE Sailboats. Evidence suggests that Mr. Williams used these photos to disclose confidential design information to his new employer, Superior Sailmakers. The examination revealed multiple copies of the images stored on a USB device associated with Mr. Williams. The findings substantiate the allegation of intellectual property misuse, and legal action is pending based on the recovered evidence.
